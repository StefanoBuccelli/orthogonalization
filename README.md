# orthogonalization
understanding orthogonalization (starting from Hipp et. al 2012)

In scripts:
- orthogonalization shows in polar coordinates 2 samples from 2 complex signals (the equivalent of a synthetic spectra)
- hipp_simulation shows different plots with aim (not yet reached) to replicate results from supplementary material of hipp.

Here you can find different repositories: https://github.com/OHBA-analysis, such as HMM-MAR that deals, among the other things with orthogonalization. Under examples/, there are scripts demonstrating the analysis conducted for the papers:
